# Summary of Local AI Project

## Decisions Made:

- The project will be a local conversational AI system that can help with various tasks, such as coding and writing.
- The system will be built using Python and libraries like GitHub and Hugging Face.
- We will be using transformers as the main machine learning algorithm for the project.
- The specific NLP task we want to perform is conversational AI.
- We will be using a reinforcement learning approach to make the system learn and adapt over time.
- SARSA will be the first reinforcement learning algorithm we will use, but we are open to exploring other techniques as well.
- We will fine-tune a transformer-based language model that is designed for conversation and dialogue, such as GPT-3, DialoGPT, or BlenderBot.
- The project will be open source and hosted on GitHub.
- We will need to choose a free and open source software license that allows us to distribute and modify the code.
- We may face challenges such as the need for large amounts of training data, ethical implications, and limitations of the reinforcement learning approach.
- We may explore future directions such as different machine learning algorithms, expanding the range of tasks, and integration with other software or devices.

## Decisions to be Made:

- Identify potential challenges, such as the need for large amounts of training data, ethical implications, and limitations of the reinforcement learning approach.

## Remarks on Installation Script:

- We created an installation script to automate the process of installing the Hugging Face Transformers library and its dependencies.
- The script checks for root privileges, Python3, and pip3 before installing the library.
- We added the `set -e` command to exit immediately if any command fails.
- The script installs the library using `pip3` and checks the installation location.
- We demonstrated how to check if the library is already installed before attempting to install it.
- This script was created on June 24, 2023, and is subject to change as new requirements or issues arise.

## Future Work:

- We will continue to refine the project goals and make decisions on the implementation details as needed.
- We will continue to explore potential challenges and ways to mitigate them.
- We will continue to develop and improve the installation script and other tools as needed.
