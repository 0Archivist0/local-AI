# Localized-AI
Personal project in an attempt to make a local AI using AI.. go figure.. but to start,is gonna be an adventure in of itself
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 10-12-23
added some scripts and also would like to point out this article that the scripts are based on

https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/you-can-now-run-a-gpt-3-level-ai-model-on-your-laptop-phone-and-raspberry-pi/

these three scripts are currently being run on a dell laptop
will provide more info later
1) llama.py
2) llama-installer.sh
3) llama-installer2.sh
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### (Update 8-25-23)
The local AI Is installed in my laptop, running roughly, but running...
I'll be uploading files shortly, but these are the ones in the computer Im on, an older laptop, with un-even RAM.. 10Gs of it with a 1000G of HDD storage... it takes up alot, and the machine is a old dell, nearly a decade old

----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### The automated scripts that were made


the botpressor was used to get botpress in the computer

the dlamascript was used to get the llama in the machine, after doing so quantizizing it ( like thats a real word) was used to make it smaller,
     - I had to download the 7B model to start with
     
Rasascript was another in an attempt to get the open source code of RASA in the machine.. so far only a few things have worked and or went through
